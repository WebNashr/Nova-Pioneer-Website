                <h2 class="centered-title"> The DNA of any Nova Pioneer Primary classroom</h2>

                <p>As students are welcomed into their learning environments we expect them to be excited to experience joyful learning. Each day commences with a morning meeting where learners and teachers are welcomed into the classroom. These meetings set the tone for each day, develop classroom culture and build a sense of community. Here, students share personal thoughts and experiences which provide teachers with contexts for understanding each individual student. Responsive classroom practices ensure respectful and inclusive environments to build the confidence of all students.</p>

                <h2 class="centered-title">Collaboration</h2>
                <img src="<?php echo novap_get_baseurl(); ?>/img/image-wide-1-sa.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Collaboration is an essential 21st century skill and developing it starts early. The term global village is never more relevant than in the school of today, and more so in the world that our students will enter. Building relationships in critical conversations and debate, sharing and group probing solving supports ethical action and personal leadership. The collaborative arrangement of the classroom space encourages this conversation and positive argument, and grows adaptive servant leaders through consistent interaction with peers, teachers and the community.</p>

                <img src="<?php echo novap_get_baseurl(); ?>/img/image-wide-1-sa.jpg" alt="">
                <p>In investigations, the natural curiosity and wonder of the student is engaged to create rich learning opportunities, where the teacher is the co-collaborator and learner along with the students and documents the students’ exploration process. Students are invited to ask “why”, to share theories, discuss possibilities, have opportunity to research and investigate outcomes in groups and with teachers. The students’ enquiries are used by the teachers to extract and make connections to the curriculum to enhance the students’ understanding. Investigations are documented in notes, photos and video to be used for further engagement and deeper learning from the student’s interests.</p>
